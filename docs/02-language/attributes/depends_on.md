# Depends_on attribute

The `depends_on` attribute allows to handle hidden resource or module/package dependencies that `KFor`m cannot automatically infer. You only need to explicitly specify a dependency when a resource or module/package relies on another resource's behavior but does not access any of that resource's data in its arguments.

## Processing impact

The `depends_on` attributes instructs Kform to complete all actions on the dependency resource  before performing any actions on the resource declaring the dependency. When the dependency resource is a module/package, `depends_on` affects the order in which Kform processes all of the resources associated with that module.

Instead of `depends_on`, we recommend using expression references to imply dependencies when possible. Expression references let KForm understand which value the reference derives from and avoid planning changes if that particular value hasnâ€™t changed, even if other parts of the upstream object have planned changes.

## Usage

You can use the `depends_on` attribute in all block-types except the `input` block-type. It requires a list of references to other resources or child modules/packages in the same calling module/package expressed as a comma, seperated string. This list cannot include arbitrary expressions because the `depends_on` value must be known before Kform knows resource relationships and thus before it can safely evaluate expressions.

It is good practice to document why a depend_on attribute is needed. The following example uses depends_on to handle a "hidden" dependency on the kubernetes_manifest.my-namespace.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: my-namespace
  annotations:
    kform.dev/block-type: resource
    kform.dev/resource-type: kubernetes_manifest 

---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app
  namespace: my-namespace
  labels:
    app: my-app
  annotations:
    kform.dev/block-type: resource
    kform.dev/resource-type: kubernetes_manifest 
    kform.dev/resource-id: deployment
    #depend_on hidden dependency to the kubernetes_manifest.my-namespace resource
    kform.dev/depends_on: kubernetes_manifest.my-namespace
